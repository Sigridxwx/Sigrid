      <div class="paragraph"> The second album from one of Atlanta’s most promising rappers
        recasts him as a star in waiting. He writes with grisly clarity and humor, and his
        songs here are sturdy, inventive, and sticky. <br> <br> <br>
        i am > i was shatters the notion of 21 Savage as a specialist with a narrow purview
        and audience, and recasts him as a star in waiting, all without forcing him into
        unflattering contortions. It also cements him as a far more original stylist than
        other hopefuls from Atlanta, like Lil Baby and Gunna, who appear here together
        and sound simply like Young Thug disciples. At its best, the album is still
        weird, like when 21 raps earnestly over Santana, or when he ends with a Young
        Nudy duet that sounds for all the world like the third act of a Morricone western.
        That’s the song where 21 sneers at rappers who “drop a mixtape, then they tattoo their face.”
        It gets at the core idea of his work: You can’t.

      <div class="paragraph"> <br><br> Geography is the debut studio album by English musician
        Tom Misch. It was self-released on 6 April 2018 through Misch's own label Beyond the Groove.
        <br><br><br> Misch met Dayes at the launch party for his album, Geography in the summer of
        2018, but Misch had been a fan of Dayes' work in the band Yussef Kamaal even before that.
        And strangely, Misch might have seen him play for the first time a decade and a half prior
        "I actually remember going to a talent show when I was like 7 or something," he recalls.
        "I remember going to a local school in my area and seeing this guy play drums — he was
        about 9 at the time. I remember thinking 'This guy's amazing at drums,' and then fast-forward
        15 years, when I'm working on this record, I realize that guy was Yussef."

        Changes is the fifth studio album by Canadian singer Justin Bieber.[2][3] It was released
        on February 14, 2020, by Def Jam Recordings and RBMG serving as the follow-up to Purpose (2015). <br><br><br>
        At the center of this whirlwind lies Changes, his first album in four years. On it, Bieber returns
        to us a wiser man—the emphasis, here, strenuously, on “man.” As of 2018, he is happily married to
        Hailey Bieber, née Baldwin, model and daughter of Stephen. Bieber is newly sober, newly wed. Now is
        the time for stubbly beards stroked fondly, for wry smiles at the memories of youthful folly, for a
        sharp decline in public-urination incidents. But above all, now is time for sex. More precisely, for
        love-making, of the most grown-up and responsible variety—no giggling, constant eye contact. His fifth
        studio album is pitched as an invitation to bask in Bieber’s newfound domestic bliss, but while his
        contentment might be heaven for him and his managers, the resulting album has all the glow and
        eroticism of an airport terminal.

       Painful is the sixth studio album by American indie rock band Yo La Tengo, released in 1993 by record
       label Matador, their first for the label. <br><br><br>
       At the start of The Last Waltz — the Band’s brilliant concert film — there’s a disclaimer:
       “This film should be played loud!”
       Such is our relationship with rock music. Much of its power is derived through sheer volume.
       What’s the first thing we want to do when we hear anything we love on the radio? Turn it up,
       of course. It’s a natural inclination, to want to hear better the sounds we love. But is volume
       an essential element of rock music? Can it be powerful without being loud, or rather, without
       relying on decibels as the main conduit of that power?Instead of trading in volume, Painful posits
       that rock music can be about taking up space. It doesn’t have to scream at us, but it sure can
       crowd us, taking up all the air in the room so that we have to pay attention. All the vocals here,
       even at their most forceful, feel faint, even whispered. Ira Kaplan’s voice is emotive, constantly
       strained, but rarely shouting.
